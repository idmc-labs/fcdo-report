Only about five per cent of the displacement records IDMC collected in 2021 included some form of age disaggregation. Quality, timely and comparable data on displaced children’s education is severely lacking. National governments are primarily responsible for the provision of education to IDPs and related data collection, but most do not monitor IDPs’ education status systematically. This may be due to capacity and resource constraints, political factors, and lack of coordination and data sharing. Local and international organisations collect data on IDPs’ education. They often use different methodologies and age groups, however, which makes it difficult to standardise and compare figures.';
export const internallyDisplacedParagraph2 = '“Data on internally displaced children is indispensable for designing better programmes and monitoring their effectiveness.

IDMC has developed a methodology that uses national-level demographic data from the UN World Population Prospects to estimate the number of internally displaced boys and girls of a school age in the 13 countries selected for study. We applied the percentage of each country’s population by broad age groups and sex to the number of IDPs at the end of 2021 to obtain our figures. We used two broad age groups: five to 11 for pre-primary and primary school; and 12 to 17 for secondary school.';
export const dataInternallyDisplacedDescription2 = 'These numbers are likely to be conservative given IDMC’s figures of the total number of IDPs in each country are likely to be underestimates. Evidence from various countries also shows that the proportion of children among displaced populations is often higher than among the general population. Despite the limitations, the estimates give a sense of the scale of the issue. The fact that children represent more than 30 per cent of all IDPs across the 13 countries makes it clear that their experiences and needs cannot be ignore.';

export const estimatingEducationParagraph1 = '​Understanding the cost of providing quality education to internally displaced children is important to inform strategic planning and fundraising goals. Global and country-level data on education costs for children in general is limited, however, and even more so for IDPs. In the absence of more precise figures, IDMC has developed a methodology based on data from OCHA’s 2021 humanitarian response plans to estimate the cost of providing school-aged IDPs with education support in the 13 countries. This includes the cost of providing learning materials, school uniforms and temporary classrooms, and indirect costs linked with implementation and services delivery.';
export const estimatingEducationParagraph2 = 'For each country, we estimated the cost of providing education support for one internally displaced child for a year and then multiplied the figure by our estimates of the number of children aged five to 17 living in displacement at the end of 2021.

export const qualityEducationParagraph1 = 'Displacement affects children’s education in many ways, reducing access and undermining equity, quality and the way it is managed. Schooling is most often interrupted, sometimes only for a few days or weeks, but in other cases for much longer.

Displaced girls tend to face heightened barriers to learning (see spotlight).';
