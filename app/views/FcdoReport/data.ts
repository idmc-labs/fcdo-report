Only about five per cent of the displacement records IDMC collected in 2021 included some form of age disaggregation. Quality, timely and comparable data on displaced children’s education is severely lacking. National governments are primarily responsible for the provision of education to IDPs and related data collection, but most do not monitor IDPs’ education status systematically. This may be due to capacity and resource constraints, political factors, and lack of coordination and data sharing. Local and international organisations collect data on IDPs’ education. They often use different methodologies and age groups, however, which makes it difficult to standardise and compare figures.';

We applied the percentage of each country’s population by broad age groups and sex to the number of IDPs at the end of 2021 to obtain our figures.
